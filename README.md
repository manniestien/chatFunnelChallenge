Thanks for your interest in joining ChatFunnels! To help us evaluate your technical ability, we have a take-home programming exercise for you. There is no time limit, and you can use the internet, books, etc. to help you complete the task. If you have any questions, we encourage you to ask! Feel free to reach out over text, email, or LinkedIn.

This repository is a basic fake weather app, and it has a bunch of failing tests. Your task is to get the project up and running, look through the list of failed tests, and do your best to fix the bugs. It is possible that the instructions below won't work for your computer without some trial and error, but try to work through it.

**If you are having trouble getting your environment set up on Windows, you may find it helpful to use Ubuntu, which can be installed for free through the Windows store.

If you aren't able to get everything running or can't fix all the tests, thatâ€™s okay. Just do as much as you feel comfortable with.
